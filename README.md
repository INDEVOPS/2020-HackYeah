# 2020 HackYeah

It is hard find a good way to ask question regarding pandemic without knowledge about the subject. Our solution allows for asking questions in common way without having to think about the right query.

The prototype covers following scenario: user asks questions regarding the virus and then server based on tensorflow matches user input with answers we added to backend database.

Project currently contains:

 - administration panel
 - webiste client
 - tensorflow server
 
Plans for the future:

 - adding more data to the database
 - question form autocompletion
